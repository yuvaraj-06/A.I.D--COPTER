# INSPIRATION: -

**COVID-19**; a particle that is just as small as **60-140nm** in diameter just wrecked the entire globe. It ruined massive industries like the Tech industry, E-commerce Industry, Travel and Tourism industry, Agriculture Industry, and many other vital sources for income. We are in wreckage now. Around 2.5% to 3% of economic loss can be observed in the G.D.P. over 2020, and this is above suspicion when we consider that these numbers are in billions and trillions. Around 40% of the jobs might evaporate too. Worse luck, this has even taken the lives of many innocents also, which is the prime inspiration for our project.


# PROPOSED SOLUTION: -

We built a project, called the **A.I.D. COPETER** which can be used for the public by the respective officials. **Drones** are believed to be a “game-changer” for fighting this COVID-19 pandemic. These aerial robots have a special kind of aura for themselves. During this situation, where the globe is in a strict lockdown, my team has come up with a few cardinal ideas. These ideas, when implemented in the real world, will bring up the change we wanted. 
A.I.D. COPTER, which stands for **Aware**, **Inspect**, and **Deliver**. These are the three trivial things which saves someone’s skin during the strict lockdown which is being implemented across the globe. 

**Aware**: - This is the time where people of all types need to get aware of the current situation.
1. Our prototyped solution would be enabled with a stentorian (loud and powerful) speaker, which is compatible with the drone. This speaker can be used to give proper guidelines to the people who aren’t following the laws during this pandemic.
2. Our project is enabled with an **A.I. chatbot**, which can be used for the predictive analysis of the near future. This bot can help the users to be aware of the COVID-19 symptoms. They can even approach us via this manner too. The bot is enabled to analyze the database.
3. We are using AI models to analyse the current database of covid 19 cases and predict future hotspots to create awareness before the virus hits.

**Inspect**: -  Keeping an eye over the people is always essential, and it suits the best during this time.
1.  Keeping the aerial reconnoitre in mind, we can keep an eye on the lawbreakers. This solution helps the police by not getting in contact with the virus at any given a chance.
2. Real-time surveillance is equipped with A.I. algorithms to detect people in groups and later in from the task and the medical staff with the exact place of the incident.
3. We are currently working on using existing Bluetooth databases of infected people to identify which person is  infected in each group. [Provided, everyone has turned their device Bluetooth ON]

**Deliver**: - It is vital to keep our tummy full and ourselves hygienic. So, we at A.I.D. COPTERS even deliver too.
1. Providing delivery services back to the dependent people during the lockdown is necessary. This is one of the most significant hit services due to this lockdown, and we are getting it back.
2. We are trying to provide items like **soaps, sanitizers, medicines, face masks, and other essential items like gloves**. All of this would be running securely on the **Ethereum network**.
3. The current prototyped drone would be capable of lifting a payload of 4Kg.

# WHAT AND HOW WE BUILT IT: -
We used our experience to make this project, we cool high-end A.I. algorithms which can be used to detect a group of people at once and we integrated it to an app where we get an alert when the copters camera detects the group. This in real time can be monitored by the government officials to act when they find the detected location with the help of GPS. Our prototyped solution completely supports the current edicts given by the governments. We have added a speaker, which can inform people who are violating the government rules, and also added an external option to take a photo of that public person, which helps the officials to take strict actions. We have made an app and a web application so that the user can order essential items like soaps, sanitizers, medicines, face masks, and other essential items like gloves. All of this would be running securely and well structured on the **Ethereum** network.

# CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO: -

1. Integrating the object detection into the drone’s camera is a big challenge that we faced during the hackathon.
2. Using **AI CHATBOT** for the first time was challenging.
3. The most important thing is to integrate the sub-modules to a whole project prototype.


# ACCOMPLISHMENTS WE ARE PROUD OF: -

We knew it was a hard task to implement our idea on a totally new platform and environment without our physical selves being at one place due to COVID-19 lockdown, but we challenged ourselves to fight it till the end and we did it. Being able to transform our idea into a project that could be displayed, feels great! We will never step back in life from trying something new every time. We now feels ambitious to keep solving global problems with our ideas. 

 # FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS : -
A further succeeding idea would be to make a network of these **Autonomous** copters to make things done in an accelerated way.
